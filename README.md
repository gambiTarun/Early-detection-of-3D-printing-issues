# Early-detection-of-3D-printing-issues
The aim of this competition is to forecast a particular type of flaw that occurs in 3D printing, which is under extrusion. Although 3D printing is a modern technique for producing objects from various 3D models, it is vulnerable to errors, and one way to identify such errors is by using a close-up camera positioned close to the printer nozzle.
